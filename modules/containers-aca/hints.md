You can use the Portal to inspect and update scale settings, but container compute is read-only from the main blade.

In any case the CLI is the repeatable experience - check the help for `containerapp update`.

Note that ACA is not as flexible as ACI when it comes to setting CPU and memory values...

I use [Fortio](https://fortio.org) for load testing. It's easy to use and you can run it in Docker.
